I'm lookin' for a new place to live and Zillow has an API! That's free!

# Basics
The docs for the Zillow API can be found [here](https://www.zillow.com/howto/api/APIOverview.htm?utm_source=email&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=emo-apiregistration-api).

There are also many other possible real-estate APIs to play with.
There's a nice gist of these that can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/patpohler/36c731113fd113418c0806f62cbb9e30).
